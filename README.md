This is a student repository created for the ZMorphVX Printer with Thick Paste Extruder, owned by the TU/e (Eindhoven University of Technology).


Here you can find:
- A folder with STLs of luer lock nozzles. We've achieved good results with FDM printing these nozzles at 0.1mm layer height. Resin printing could also be an option. Please bear in mind that 3D-printed nozzles will not be food safe!
- A ZMorphVX Thick Paste Cura Profile. With this profile we obtained good flow results with a 2mm nozzle and vegan (aqua faba) meringue mixture
