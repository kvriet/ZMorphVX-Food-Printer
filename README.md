This is a student repository created for the ZMorphVX Printer with Thick Paste Extruder, owned by the TU/e (Eindhoven University of Technology).


Here you can find:
- A folder with STLs of luer lock nozzles. We've achieved good results with FDM printing these nozzles at 0.1mm layer height. Resin printing could also be an option. Please bear in mind that 3D-printed nozzles will not be food safe!
- A ZMorphVX Thick Paste Cura Profile. With this profile we obtained good flow results with a 2mm nozzle and vegan (aqua faba) meringue mixture. Baking these prints in the oven produced disappointing results. We obtained better results with meringue prints from egg (non-vegan).
- A logbook with our lab notes where we describe what we tried in terms of printing material, geometries (infill settings) and printer settings.

About the Cura profiles:
- We sometimes observed problems importing the profiles into newer versions of Cura. These profiles were created in Cura 4.6.
- If the Cura profile doesn't load correctly, these are the main things to try to adjust:
* speed (10 to 20 mm/s seems to work well)
* flow (between 5 and 15%)
* line width and layer height roughly the same, and should be your nozzle size
* No spiralise outer contour
