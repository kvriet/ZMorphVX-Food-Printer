Lab notes for developing a paste for 3D printing and exploring different printing geometries and techniques

Meringue printing #1 - 9/11/2021

Objective: get a feel for the printer with an existing food 3D printing recipe.

Results: We didn't manage to print anything due to missing parts / nozzles that were too short.

Problems:
- nozzle approx. 14mm too short
- (syringe doesn't go into x carriage deep enough)

Solutions:
- (resin) print new nozzles to fit luer lock syringe
- extend current nozzle
- buy longer nozzles


Meringue printing #2 - 15/11/2021

Objective: get a feel for the printer with a vegan 3D food printing recipe

Done since last time:
- FDM printed a number of nozzles in PLA (0.1 layer height): 0.75, 1, 1.5, 2, 3mm

Results: 
Mixture #1: 
Ingredients aqua faba (didn't weigh but probably 150 gr) + 250gr sugar + 1/2 tsp cream of tartar. 20 mins of whipping: still not firm enough for printing in height. Much less firm than egg white meringue.

Mixture #2:
Added 1 packet of klopfix to remainder (1/2?) of the mixture but still too soft
We used a creme brulee burner to bake the meringues a little which helped them retain their shape.

Meringue printing #3 - 17/11/2021

Objectives: make a firmer vegan meringue mixture and print with it

Results:
Mixture #1:
- 94 gr aqua faba
- 47 gr sugar
- 141 gr sugar
- 47 gr water
- 1.3 gr cream of tartar

This meringue is much more firm! First succesful print!

Cura profile:
- initial layer height: 0.5mm
- lower layer: 2mm
- initial flow: 15%
- normal flow: 5%

We need to keep track of the total volume of what we want to print as our syringe volume is roughly 70ml.


Meringue printing #4 - 18/11/2021

Objectives: add agar to the meringue mixture and test with print

Results:
Mixture #1:
- 104 gr aqua faba
- 52 gr water
- 158 gr sugar
- 52 gr water
- 1.3 gr cream of tartar
- 0.8 gr agar

Printed a hollow cylinder without bottom. Was quite firm but showed buckling at the base. Printed bar held up quite well but started showing buckling on infill at roughly layer 5. Top infill worked well.


Meringue printing #5 - 24/11/2021

Objectives: add chlorella to the meringue mixture and test with print
try different geometries and print settings to create higher resolution
try baking the prints in the oven straight away

Results
Mixture #1:
- 92 gr aqua faba
- 46 gr sugar
Whip until stiff

- 46 gr water
- 138 gr water
- 1.3 gr cream of tartar
Boil to 120 degrees C

Add hot sugar mix to aqua faba whip

Add
- 1.38 gr agar to the warm mix

Add
- 1.3 gr chlorella to the mix

The meringue did not become stiff/firm. We think this was vecause 20 mins elapsed between whipping the aqua faba and adding the sugar water.


Mixture #2:
- 96 gr aqua faba
- 48 gr sugar
Whip until stiff

- 48 gr water
- 144 gr water
- 1.3 gr cream of tartar
Boil to 120 degrees C

Add hot sugar mix to aqua faba whip

Add
- 0.96 gr agar to the warm mix (1% of aqua faba amount)

Add
- 3.8 gr chlorella to the mix (1% of total mixture (minus chlorella) amount)

The meringue was firmer than the mixture without chlorella (18/11/2021). Possibly adding the chlorella enabled the colloid function of the small chlorella particles.

Baked all of them in the oven at 100 degrees Celsius for 30-45 mins. 

Finding:
With a 15% lines infill, we could see the infill through the top layer of the baked meringue. This is an interesting effect that we can possibly leverage in future designs. Most of the bars looked like rectangular blobs after baking. 

Future steps/things to check:
Maybe increase heat a little (130?) to make the meringue set more quickly, thus reducing sag and maintaining the printed shape better. We could also place an oven thermometer inside the oven to check if it really heats up to 100 degrees. Also, we placed the bars directly on to the metal plate at the bottom of the oven. A raised platform (with a finer mesh to prevent meringue from sagging through) might work better. Now the bottom of the bars got burnt because of the hot metal sheet. Maybe we can use the foaminess of the meringue batter as an asset/feature in our designs?

New profile created for 1mm nozzles.

The following settings seem to work well:
- 2mm layer height
- 1mm nozzle 
- flow rate: 5% for lines, or 10% for tri-hex (always 15% initial layer)
- speed 5 mm/s
- infill: 10% lines or 15% tri-hex
- no bottom
- experiment with no top
