Meringue printing #1 - 9/11/2021

Objective: get a feel for the printer with an existing food 3D printing recipe.

Results: We didn't manage to print anything due to missing parts / nozzles that were too short.

Problems:
- nozzle approx. 14mm too short
- (syringe doesn't go into x carriage deep enough)

Solutions:
- (resin) print new nozzles to fit luer lock syringe
- extend current nozzle
- buy longer nozzles


Meringue printing #2 - 15/11/2021

Objective: get a feel for the printer with a vegan 3D food printing recipe

Done since last time:
- FDM printed a number of nozzles in PLA (0.1 layer height): 0.75, 1, 1.5, 2, 3mm

Results: 
Mixture #1: 
Ingredients aqua faba (didn't weigh but probably 150 gr) + 250gr sugar + 1/2 tsp cream of tartar. 20 mins of whipping: still not firm enough for printing in height. Much less firm than egg white meringue.

Mixture #2:
Added 1 packet of klopfix to remainder (1/2?) of the mixture but still too soft
We used a creme brulee burner to bake the meringues a little which helped them retain their shape.

Meringue printing #3 - 17/11/2021

Objectives: make a firmer vegan meringue mixture and print with it

Results:
Mixture #1:
- 94 gr aqua faba
- 47 gr sugar
- 141 gr sugar
- 47 gr water
- 1.3 gr cream of tartar

This meringue is much more firm! First succesful print!

Cura profile:
- initial layer height: 0.5mm
- lower layer: 2mm
- initial flow: 15%
- normal flow: 5%

We need to keep track of the total volume of what we want to print as our syringe volume is roughly 70ml.


Meringue printing #4 - 18/11/2021

Objectives: add agar to the meringue mixture and test with print

Results:
Mixture #1:
- 104 gr aqua faba
- 52 gr water
- 158 gr sugar
- 52 gr water
- 1.3 gr cream of tartar
- 0.8 gr agar

Printed a hollow cylinder without bottom. Was quite firm but showed buckling at the base. Printed bar held up quite well but started showing buckling on infill at roughly layer 5. Top infill worked well.
