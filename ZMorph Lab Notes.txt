Meringue printing #1 - 9/11/2021

Objective: get a feel for the printer with an existing food 3D printing recipe.

Results: We didn't manage to print anything due to missing parts / nozzles that were too short.

Problems:
- nozzle approx. 14mm too short
- (syringe doesn't go into x carriage deep enough)

Solutions:
- (resin) print new nozzles to fit luer lock syringe
- extend current nozzle
- buy longer nozzles


Meringue printing #2 - 15/11/2021

Objective: get a feel for the printer with a vegan 3D food printing recipe

Done since last time:
- FDM printed a number of nozzles in PLA (0.1 layer height): 0.75, 1, 1.5, 2, 3mm

Results: 
Mixture #1: 
Ingredients aqua faba (didn't weigh but probably 150 gr) + 250gr sugar + 1/2 tsp cream of tartar. 20 mins of whipping: still not firm enough for printing in height. Much less firm than egg white meringue.

Mixture #2:
Added 1 packet of klopfix to remainder (1/2?) of the mixture but still too soft
We used a
